## Inspiration
As developers, we are always exploring new projects and open-source repositories. However, the complexity and scale of these codebases serve as a major barrier to entry even for the most experienced developers. We wanted to create a tool that would help developers navigate these codebases more effectively, answering questions and providing context on both specific and broad aspects of the codebase. 

Ever since ChatGPT released in November of 2022, large language models have permeated every aspect of our lives. In particular, developers are using these models to enhance their productivity, particularly through the use of code generation. However many copilot products lack a true understanding of the repository and codebase, limited in scope by their low amount of context. 

Simultaneously, prompt engineering has become a popular method for improving the performance of language models. Specificaly, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been shown to be effective as a way to ground LLMs within a specific context, reducing their chance of hallucinations and enabling them to generate more accurate and relevant responses. Even more recently, graph RAG models have proven to be a particularly fast and computationally efficient way to organize information and utilize a knowledge graph to improve query results.
